        <h2>Returns</h2>
        <p>Need to make a return? No problem, we'll even take care of the shipping charges.</p>
        <p>We accept returns and exchanges on unworn merchandise for up to one year from the shipping date, but only on
            shoes purchased through <a href="/">samuelhubbard.com</a>.</p>
        <p>If you purchased from another retailer, you'll need to return your items
            at the original place of purchase.</p>
        <p>To return an item to us, fill out a <a href="/static_return_form.php">Return Form</a>, for a prepaid shipping label and follow the
            instructions on the page. We promise it's simple as do-re-mi:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Put the shoes back in their original box and place in an outer carton.</li>
            <li><a href="/static_return_form.php">Print a label</a>, slap it on the carton (not the shoebox, please).
            </li>
            <li>Bring the package to a UPS store or UPS Drop Box, or give it to a UPS driver.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After we receive the shoes and inspect them, we'll issue you a full credit in the form of your original
            method of payment, including any taxes paid. Keep in mind the inspection could take a few days and the
            refund may take one or two billing cycles to appear on your credit card statement.</p>

        <h2>Exchanges</h2>
        <p>The quickest way to exchange a product is to place a new order and return your original purchase at the same
            time. Doing so will ensure that you'll get the new product quickly and that it won't go out of stock while
            you wait for the return to be received.</p>
        <p>Just place a new order and return your original item using the <a href="/static_return_form.php">Return
                Form</a>. You'll receive a full refund for items returned in new, unused condition as soon as your
            return is received and processed by our Returns Department.</p>
