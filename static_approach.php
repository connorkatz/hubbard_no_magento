        <p>We begin with defining how our shoes will be used.</p>
        <p>In the case of our Start-Up collection, we set out to make an 'everyday shoe' for people with an active
            lifestyle.</p>
        <p>These shoes are for going to work and getting around town comfortably. They needed to be a great
            walking shoe, as distinct from a sneaker that could be used for walking. They needed to be lightweight to
            provide comfort when sitting and when walking. We wanted this collection to be sturdily built and easily
            re-soled, so that the shoes would have a long life.</p>
        <p>Comfort engineering is at the heart of how we design and build Samuel Hubbard shoes. We begin by taking the
            time to develop perfect fitting lasts. In the case of this first new collection, it took us nearly one year
            of trials and corrections and more trials. Unlike many other shoe companies that rush new looks to market
            every six months, we give ourselves the time to refine every aspect of our shoes so that we will make them
            as comfortable as possible. In this pursuit, we are uncompromising in our choice of materials and
            constructions. Designing our Start-Up collection took over 15 months before we began the initial
            manufacturing. Being just "good enough" is not good enough for us. If there is a better method, if there are
            better materials, that is what we choose. We produce all of the prototypes in our own sizes so that we can
            test our development work personally from the very first pair.</p>
        <p>Having established this foundation for a new shoe, we then move to the consideration of style and the fashion
            of the collection. We bring this part of the design work in only when we are satisfied that the foundation
            is as good as we can make it. We love beautiful soft, aniline-dyed leathers and the best possible leather
            linings to give Samuel Hubbard shoes their rich, natural appeal. Because the comfort and walking
            characteristics of each model are so important to us, these elements are expressed in each style we make. It
            is not surprising that when people see our shoes for the first time they often say that the shoes 'look very
            comfortable'. Our shoe lasts are designed around the shape of people's feet and you will not find pointed
            toes or high heels in our designs. We know that we cannot achieve our own high standards of comfort and
            walking function with those style elements.</p>
        <p>We believe in the idea that form follows function and this is what is expressed in our designs. Our family
            tradition over the last 85 years has been to make the most comfortable shoes that people can buy. With the
            new Samuel Hubbard Start-Up collection we are continuing in that tradition. We invite you to try a pair
            yourself. We want Samuel Hubbard to be the pair of shoes in your closet that you reach for when you know you
            are going to be walking and standing a great deal. If these aren't the most comfortable shoes you have ever
            worn, we want to hear from you. Share with us whatever ideas you have and you can be certain that we will be
            listening. We try to learn something new every time we begin a new design and, with your help, we look
            forward to continuing in our family tradition of making the finest possible shoes.</p>
