        <p>Samuel Hubbard shoes are constructed so that they can be nicely resoled.</p>
        <p>We have set up a program with John Bradley at Resole America. He has an excellent facility and we are
            supplying him with original Vibram soles so that your shoes can be as comfortable as the day you first wore
            them.
        </p>
        <p>He will send you a shipping label and pouch to ship the shoes to the resoling facility and they will ship the
            shoes back to your home directly.</p>
        <p>In addition to putting on brand-new Vibram soles, Resole America will also clean the leather uppers and
            provide new shoe laces. You can also order new or extra insoles if you wish.</p>
        <p>As a special service we can also change the sole color for you. Regardless of the original color, you may
            choose from:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>White</li>
            <li>Black</li>
            <li>Brown</li>
            <li>Tan</li>
            <li>Light Grey</li>
            <li>Medium Dark Grey</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you do not select a new color, the shoes will be resoled with the original color.</p>
        <p>The shoes will be returned with a waterproof spray on them which we recommend you apply to the suede and
            nubuck shoes every three or four months to help keep the leather clean.</p>
        <p>Resoling &mdash; $85 including pickup and delivery from your home</p>
        <p>New original Hubbard insoles &mdash; $60 a pair</p>
