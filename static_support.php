                <p>Want to cancel or change an order?</p>
                <p>We'll try our best, but keep in mind we want to get your order out as quickly as possible so you and
                    your new shoes can get to know each other better. If it's within an hour of placing an order, we may
                    be able to change or cancel, so please call us as soon as possible and we'll see what we can do. Our
                    business hours are 9am &ndash; 5pm Pacific Time, Monday through Friday, not including holidays.
                    (844) 482-4800 or <a href="mailto:weborders@samuelhubbard.com">weborders@samuelhubbard.com</a>.</p>

                <h2>Sizing</h2>
                <p>Samuel Hubbard shoes are made using the American size scale. Some companies have begun to use the
                    European size scale, but there are fewer sizes in that scale. By using the American size scale, we
                    can achieve a more accurate fit.</p>

                <p>European sizes for men run between 41 and 50. American sizes run from size 7 to 16. (Please note that
                    at this time, size 14 is our largest size and is limited to a few styles – see chart below). If your
                    shoes are marked in European sizes, you can use our Size Conversion Chart to find your American
                    size. You can also carefully trace your foot on paper and look up your size on the same chart in
                    either inches or centimeters. Make sure you are standing, wearing the socks you will wear with your
                    new shoes. Click here for the Size Conversion Chart.</p>

                <p>We have also provided a Foot Measuring Tool. Print out the ‘measuring tool’ and piece the two pages
                    together using the alignment arrows. Finding your size is explained on the tool itself.</p>
